    "with existing genomics tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. FASTQ (ONT Ultra-long, PacBio HiFi)**\n",
    "- Stores raw sequencing reads with base qualities.\n",
    "- Chosen because it is the standard for raw long-read data and is accepted by all major aligners.\n",
    "- Recommended tools: `minimap2`, `seqkit`, `NanoPlot`, `pbccs`.\n",
    "- AWS: Can be read directly from S3 using `s3fs` or streamed into alignment jobs on EC2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. uBAM (Unaligned BAM)**\n",
    "- Binary version of FASTQ with read-level metadata preserved.\n",
    "- Useful for workflows requiring read grouping, UUID tracking, or metadata-aware QC.\n",
    "- Tools: `samtools`, `picard`, `htslib`.\n",

    "**3. FASTA (T2T and haplotype-resolved assemblies)**\n",
    "- Represents assembled genome sequences.\n",
    "- Used because it is the universal format for genome assemblies.\n",
    "- Tools: `samtools faidx`, `seqkit`, `minimap2`.\n",
    "- AWS: FASTA indexes can be stored alongside sequence files for fast region-based retrieval.\n",

    "- Describes assembly graphs for telomere-to-telomere sequences.\n",
    "- Chosen because it captures repeat structure and alternative paths that FASTA cannot represent.\n",
    "- Tools: `Bandage`, `GFAKluge`.\n",

    "- Represents variant calls in a structured, indexed format.\n",
    "- Each `.vcf.gz` is accompanied by a `.tbi` index for random access.\n",
    "- Tools: `bcftools`, `cyvcf2`, `htslib`.\n",
    "- AWS: Athena can query tabular derivatives (e.g., parquet conversion).\n",

    "**6. VG (Graph-based pangenome format)**\n",
    "- Encodes genome graphs, GBWT haplotypes, and indexing for graph-based alignment.\n",
